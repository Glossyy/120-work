## My First README.md

** Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made. **

_ I worked on getting everything reset up after computer complications. I also worked hard to create this readme file that has taught me some new markdown tips to achieve better formatting of my readme. I spent approximately 8-9 hours on the homework for this week including watching the videos and using the programs. One of the other classes I am taking right now is using a lot of the same technology so some of the videos and things to know where already covered and made this week move a bit swifter. _


** What steps did you take to complete the assignment? **
1. I followed along with the instructions on the website so that I could follow and recreate the exact steps.
2. I utalized having two monitors to be able to have the assignment and a markdown cheat sheet open while doing this assignment.

** Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates? **
*  I had spaces in one of my file names and had a hard time getting Power Shell to find the folder. I forgot that we had a class repo issue tracker and emailed our instructor for help. I learned that if you put the file name in single quotes that Power Shell will be able to find it even with the spaces.
* I ran into an issue where my antivirus decided that Atom was a virus and it quarantined Atom and deleted it. I tried to reinstall and was given a very long error message. I remembered this time about our class repo issue tracker and received some very helpful links to others who had the same problem as me as well as a suggestion to just use Windows Defender instead of Avast. I uninstalled Avast and reinstalled Atom and now everything is working as intended.

** Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further? **
* I really enjoyed learning the different ways to commit things and actually found that once Power Shell was set up that it was very user friendly. I hope we will continue to use it as I can see it having great benefits, especially over the original command prompt for windows.

** What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle? **
_ I posted my solution to the problem of Avast removing Atom. I didn't feel like any of the other issues posted on the issue board were things that I was knolwedgable about though I hope that in the future that won't be as much of a problem for me. _
